# PL-Project
Project Instructions:
Construct an interpreter for a simple language for expressions involving fractions. Your language
should support all four basic arithmetic operations between fractions as well as parentheses.
Example: 1/5 * (2/11 - 5/3)
Adapt the ad-hoc scanner from slide 20 and the recursive descent parser from slide 41 (Chapter 2) in
order to suit your language. The interpreter should generate informed error messages, in case of
any syntax error. No semantic analysis is required.
